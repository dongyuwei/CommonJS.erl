# CommonJS.erl
An CommonJS Packager in Erlang

# Project Goal: speed, speed, and speed!
1. Bundle Common JS modules concurrently using Erlang actors. It is expected to work as [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify)
2. Watch and incrementally rebuild Common JS modules concurrently using Erlang actors. It is expected to work as [watchify](https://github.com/substack/watchify)
3. It will be a tiny and simple CommonJS Packager. I'm not plan to implement all the features like browserify.

## Status
developing in progress, not usable yet.
